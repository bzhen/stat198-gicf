# Convolutional Neural Network for Text Classification

This repository contains all the code used for our CNN model to predict Amazon's cell phone & accessories product reviews. Our work was inspired by a [paper](http://dkotzias.com/papers/GICF.pdf) from Denil et al, and our code adapted from Denny Britz's excellent [tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/11/understanding-convolutional-neural-networks-for-nlp/).
